# QR_Code_Scanner

This code is originally from Kavsoft - YouTube channel.

The code gives a very good insight on how to work with AVKit, AVCapture, AVSession, AVMetadataObject and so on.
The UI is included in the code. It's an easy demonstratory UI.
Most importantly, within the code, are the functions with "async", "await" and much more. :)

Byeeeee
